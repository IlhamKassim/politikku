"""Storage: the Baseline, the daily snapshots, and their reads and writes.

One schema over SQLAlchemy Core, so the same code runs against the free-tier
Postgres the pipeline uses (ADR 0002) and against a local SQLite file for
development. Point `DATABASE_URL` at whichever is wanted. Per-Coalition vote
share and the census profile are JSON columns rather than encoded strings, so
they stay queryable in SQL on either backend.

The Baseline is a one-time load, not daily data (ADR 0001), so writes replace
the stored snapshot wholesale inside one transaction. Running the loader twice
therefore leaves 222 rows, not 444.

    least as new as what is already there *and* has calls of its own. Both
    halves matter:

    - Only accepting a day at least as new keeps the write order-independent.
      `scripts/seed_dev_snapshots.py` backfills days behind today, and running
      it after a real run must not leave the current Projection showing a
      seeded day's calls, nor evict a kept day the seeded one is older than.
    - Only replacing when there are calls to put there means a Projection
      carrying none cannot empty the table. `load_projections` hands back every
      day but the newest with `seat_calls` empty, so a round-tripped Projection
      re-saved under a later day would otherwise silently destroy the only
      per-Seat rows in Storage.
