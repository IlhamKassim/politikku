"""The PolitikKu Observatory landing page at the site root (ADR 0017).

Renders `/` (English) and `/ms/` (Bahasa Malaysia) from the self-authored
Observatory build in `scrollcraft/builds/observatory/`. The build replaces
the previous server-rendered orientation page while keeping the existing
pipeline command, public routes, and live Seat lookup contract. The
interactive map remains one click away at `/app/`.

The page is a full-width public front door with no app chrome. Its 222-seat
chamber animation is explanatory artwork, not a current Coalition count;
the lookup is the live platform feature mounted by `public/lookup.js`.
Static Observatory assets are copied into the generated `public/assets/`
tree during the same build that writes the English and Bahasa pages.

Every SPA deep link (`politikku.my/#parlimen/parti`, `/#seat-P.102`) was a
root URL until ADR 0017 moved the SPA to `/app/`. Without this the whole
existing set of shared links, bookmarks and indexed results would land on
the landing page carrying a fragment that means nothing here.

Two properties are load-bearing:

- **It runs before `_language_persistence_script`.** That script redirects
  on `location.pathname` alone, so a deep link reaching it first would
  arrive at `/ms/` with the fragment already dropped. See `render_shell`'s
  `extra_head_script` docstring.
- **`location.replace`, never `.href`.** No extra history entry, so Back
  from `/app/` leaves the site rather than bouncing off the landing page —
  matching every other redirect in this codebase.

**This is deliberately not a gate.** ADR 0017 originally shipped a
`pk-landing-seen` flag in `localStorage` that sent a returning visitor
straight to `/app/`, so the landing page was shown exactly once, plus a
`pk-landing-lang-switch` marker to stop that flag hijacking the language
toggle. Both are gone: the landing page is the site's front door and shows
on every visit to `/`. Do not reintroduce a "seen" flag without reading
ADR 0017's revision note first — the skip is what made the language toggle
unusable, and re-adding it re-adds that bug along with a second piece of
storage state to keep in step.

Anything that fails here fails silently into showing the landing page,
which is the correct page for `/` to show.
