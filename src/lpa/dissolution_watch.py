"""Watch the day's coverage for a dissolution, and tell *us* — never the site.

`election_status.json` is maintained by hand on purpose: its own comments say
automatic detection of a dissolution is out of scope, and that is the right
call. Malaysian coverage speculates about early polls constantly, and
"analysts expect Parliament to be dissolved" reads almost identically to
"Parliament has been dissolved" to anything matching keywords. Publishing the
second when only the first happened would put a false claim on the front door
of the site, which is the one mistake here that people screenshot.

So this module never writes to the site and never posts to the public
channel. It reads the Articles the pipeline already fetched, and if any of
them look like the event has actually happened it sends one private message
to whoever maintains the data, with the headlines and links, so a human can
check the source and edit the file. Detection, composition and delivery stay
separate for the same reason `telegram_post` keeps them apart.

**It silences itself.** A signal is only reported for a fact the status file
does not already record: once `dissolved_on` is filled in, dissolution
signals stop. Until then it will nag on every run, which is the intended
behaviour — an unanswered alert means the site is still saying something
untrue.
