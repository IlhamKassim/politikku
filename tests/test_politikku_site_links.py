"""The surviving PolitikKu pages rendered to disk, with every internal link
followed.

#104's cutover moved PolitikKu from the `/politikku/` staging prefix to the
site root, which is the kind of change that breaks links rather than tests:
each page still renders, each `href` is still well-formed, and every one of
them points at a directory that no longer exists. So this module does what a
reader would — renders every page at the path its own `main()` writes it to,
walks every `href`/`src` on each one, and resolves it against that rendered
tree.

ADR 0014 retired the old `politikku_homepage.py` surface. Its legacy routes
remain outside this renderer sweep as redirect stubs. ADR 0017 restored
`politikku_landing.py` as the orientation page at `/` and `/ms/`, while the
Bills and MP-profile renderers use their current directory routes. Those
paths are covered here: they are the pages every other page's wordmark and
methodology footer point at, and the sweep follows the map link, the two data
panels' "full ledger"/"all Bills" links, the Sentiment/Dewan/Politicians link
row and the glossary link on each.

Still excluded, for `GENERATED_BY_ANOTHER_BUILD_STEP`'s own reason — nothing
here can render them to check, not that nothing points at them: `/app/...`
(the frontend fold-in step's plain `cp -r` in `daily.yml`) and the retired
pages' old paths (`politikku_redirects.py` stubs).

Fixture data throughout, reusing the models the per-page test modules
already build, so this needs no Storage — it is a check on routing, not on
figures.
